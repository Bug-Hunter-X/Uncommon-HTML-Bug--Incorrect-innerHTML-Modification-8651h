This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in HTML related to modifying the innerHTML property.  Improper use can lead to unexpected behavior and, in certain scenarios, security vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The `bug.html` file shows the incorrect usage, while `bugSolution.html` provides the corrected approach using DOM manipulation for safer and more predictable results.
